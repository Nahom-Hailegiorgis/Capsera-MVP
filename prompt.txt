im making a progressive web app named capsera. the key features are ai feedback for product development, working without wifi, multiple users using the same device to be accessible for those in low-resource regions, and translating languages for those who lack the education to understand english. (utilize javascript)

4 screens
screen 1: global ideas screen where top scored ideas are shown in a scrollable table with the username of the person who made it, the date it was made, and the score out of 100 but when the idea is clicked a blurred background over view says no sneek peaks. under this ideas scrollable table is a feedback form thing with open ended questions for the users of this website capsera to give feedback about it to the developers (Nahom, Shourya, and Sahasra) to better it (chatgpt make the questions). there is a optional contact input to put email or phone number so if its really good feedback, the developers might contact that person personally. when user submits feedback it goes to a supabase feedback table with all the inputs (you make the schema & rls commands)
screen 2: my submissions shows compact tables of the many users idea projects separated by their names allowing a user to have many projects & when clicking the up/down arrow for more info showing the project draft number and final & after another click for more info it shows the detailed ai feedback received and next steps to upgrade draft (if final it shows score). make sure that when a user is deleted, the mysubmissions associated with that user are deleted too.
screen 3: submit ideas screen where it says some catchy phrase then says hi *username*. note that is a progressive web app that works offline with apis such as openai api and google translate & such. a key feature is that in screen 3 many users can be created on the same device (make sure the styling of this website is proportional on many devices primarily mobile & laptop using percentages. theme the website with these colors: F4E87C, 584D3D, 9F956C, CBBF7A, EBF38B, ffffff, 000000). theres 2 dropdown buttons 1 for select a user and another for select a project. there are a create button under each dropdown for creating a user & project (user can create a project once they are logged in with a user). when creating a user it better not be the same name as an already existing not-deleted user & must require a pin that is saved along with the user locally on that device to sign in always (after entering pin they have to enter this safety code that will be used if they have to change their pin or if they forget their pin in settings screen (it can be numbers or letters of whatever)). users can create a project which can't be the same name as an already-existing project & note that if the user associated with the project is deleted, the project is too so the next time a user is created with the same name as the already deleted user, the old projects dont load too. make sure the user's idea drafts, user, user pins, user projects are saved locally on the device and not in supabase. supabase will save the final project when submitted aswell as the feedback submitted. the whole point of this website (capsera) is that people in low-income (e.g. rural india) who lack resources but have good ideas can make get their ideas judged & refined then connected with mentors & funders. the mentors & funders part will be in production soon but for now the ideas must be judged by ai by submitting a project as a draft after answering a series of questions then on 3rd draft (final draft) they submit to supabase and cannot be edited afterwards. the form questions are very open-ended questions such as who does this product help? what are people using for now that works, how is it limited? how is your product better? whats the problem? whats your solution? how did you find capsera? (for analytics for devs not related to actual product development). in draft after draft you have to check if they fixed th eissue from the previous draft so the questions are different remember previous score when judging second & or 3rd draft to see if they iterated & if they did good and their score is over 80 they will put their email & connected to a mentor soon. tell user to conduct customer interviews after they submit first draft (in next draft ask them if they did and the results they found) if ai gives low score, give alot of detailed feedback compared to if it gives a high score give it reasonably lengthened feedback. make sure the questions for the user to help the developer improve their product has open-ended specific questions about the product (make the focus on the crafting open-ended questions for the user to improve their product that would work awesome for any product physical or virtual whatever it is and different for each draft number). dont be so harsh with grading. emphasize pros & cons not separating feedback by category but bullet points of pros & cons, unless the idea is absolutely awful it shouldn't be less than 70/100. give encouraging words. encourage them to look at their environment if their idea looks like its 80% or more likely made by ai. check if the user just puts spam like "e" for all the inputs or if they put very personal info (be lenient since i dont want this check to stop a perfectly normal submission that so happens to have numbers), etc. here are some questions to put for user to do for draft ideas (these are not the limit so go wild):
questions to implement for second draft:

did you conduct any form of research of market validation to validate your idea necessity?
how thouroughly did you research your competitors
did you develop an mvp (e.g. website, app,) (optional) (if they say no, add a little optional question to ask why they didn't)
upload photo if physical product (lets ask sahasra since their camera might be bad and idk a model MAY be able to detect if it's good or not)
questions & features to implement for third draft:

pitch your idea like your talking to an investor (show an example)
allow side bar to show previous drafts (select 1st or 2nd draft to look at it so they can collect their ideas for their final draft to submit (3rd draft)).
what research have you done? (to test your idea/put it out there)
did you develop an mvp (e.g. website, app,) (optional, if yes then put link here)

screen 4: settings where the user can click a language to translate to (if possible let them use a search thing so they can choose whatever language to translate every piece of text on all of the screens to that specified language). (when translated to a specified language save that locally so the next time the site is loaded it's loading that translation) alongside the custom language translate using google translate, put a few buttons to translate to these languages: hindi, bengali, telugu, marathi, and tamil, gujurati, urdu, malayalam. under this translate section of settings screen shall be users section where the scrollable list of users is put of all on the device and there is a delete button which requires the pin associated with the user selected to actually delete & to the left of that the blue change pin/forgot pin button where they can click then enter their safety code so they can change their pin. dont forget that when a user is deleted, all of its local data including mysubmissions past submissions, associated projects, etc are deleted.
structure:
- this is a netlify website so have the keys that are okay being public like supabase in bottom of index.html (e.g:
<script>
    // Public environment configuration - loaded directly in HTML for immediate availability
    // Only contains keys that are safe to expose in the browser
    window.ENV = {
      SUPABASE_URL: "https://cboescovlebokpnrsnwp.supabase.co", // Replace with your actual URL
      SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImNib2VzY292bGVib2twbnJzbndwIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTUxMjc0ODAsImV4cCI6MjA3MDcwMzQ4MH0.2mrbRIp7A14hRs_mz37sPshZOrmt0uT9UsM0JWRSvx0", // Replace with your actual anon key
      EUREKA: true, // Feature flag
      EDGE_FUNCTION_URL: "https://cboescovlebokpnrsnwp.supabase.co/functions/v1", // Replace with your actual edge function URL
    };

    console.log("Public environment configuration loaded");
  </script>)
also i'll have the openai api key & google translate key in netlify environmental variables so you can reference it like this for example:  const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
